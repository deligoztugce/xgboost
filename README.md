# XGBoost Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the use of the XGBoost classifier to classify the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a multi-class classification problem where the goal is to predict the species of the Iris flower based on the flower's attributes.

## Project Overview

We will:
1. Load the Iris dataset.
2. Preprocess the data by splitting it into training and testing sets and standardizing the features.
3. Train an XGBoost classifier.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and a detailed classification report.
5. Visualize the feature importances and the confusion matrix.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install xgboost scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
